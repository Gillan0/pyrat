# pyrat

Programming project at IMT Atlantique to learn the basics of graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS, Djikstra, TSP, ...).

This project also contains a tournament submission to see who's algorithm was the best at fetching more tokens spread across the graph in a competetive setting (ie two players traversing the graph). 
Lost only to the Winner of the tournament !
